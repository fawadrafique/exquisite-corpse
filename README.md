## How a small group of friends ended up helping orphans

During my final years in the university, a friend of mine had an idea to help the needy as we were wasting plenty of type on non-essential stuff/things. We had a brainstorming session to pinpoint the vulnerable who need the help most. We did some research and found that an estimated study suggests about 10 million children in Pakistan are pushed to child labour and most of them are orphans. So, we decided to begin helping the orphans first.
