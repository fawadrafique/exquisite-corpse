## How a small group of friends ended up helping orphans

During my final years in the university, a friend of mine had an idea to help the needy as we were wasting plenty of type on non-essential stuff/things. We had a brainstorming session to pinpoint the vulnerable who need the help most. We did some research and found that an estimated study suggests about 10 million children in Pakistan are pushed to child labour and most of them are orphans. So, we decided to begin helping the orphans first.

We made an organisation called PaCode, which goes all around Pakistan with raspberry pi's and we teach the children how to use computers and how to code. After that most children that had a fondness for coding also got in the project and began teaching coding to even more children. So five years later we already helped thousands of children, but now Pacode has even a better idea!

Pacode created a platform for learning which is also a social media platform where all children can play around with code, connect through games and challenges. :space_invader: :space_invader: :space_invader: They are learning while playing in this Pacode community. Businesses started to reach out and work together with Pacode which creates a lot of new opportunities :star_struck: 

All seemed great and we were filled with joy, as our project was finally breaking the child force cycle. Kids were given a chance to become something more than just another number for the infamous "sweatshops". Happiness and pride were filling my soul as I walked down my street that I didn't see the black SUV coming my way. In a split of a second, I was inside the black SUV, moving at lightning speed throught the small streets while being watched faithfully by guns. Nobody spoke. In my mind, I was planning to plead for my freedom, ready to beg for mercy. 

As my mind stopped rushing, my eyes began to focus on the outside world, to try to give me a sense of geographical location. It didn't make sense, and the streets were getting better by the minute. As soon as I could make out where I was, the SUV was entering a beautiful mansion, once that has been in the newspapers before, one that all the country was familiar with. As the SUV stopped and the door flung open, I was greeted with the fake smile of our president. "Glad you agreed to meet up with me in such short notice. Please, come in, we are waiting for you."
